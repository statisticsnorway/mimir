# A minimal webpack config is included with react4xp, to build your react components and their dependencies: See node_modules/react4xp-build-components/webpack.config.js.
# To change this setup, or override or extend that webpack.configjs:
# make a custom file that default-exports EITHER a finished webpack-style config object, OR a function.
# The function should take an "env" and "config" argument:
#   - Env is the collection of "--env." CLI arguments, and
#   - Config is the default config from react4xp-build-components/webpack.config.js.
# Manipulate or replace the config object AND return it.
# Example file:
#             module.exports = function(env, config) {
#                 config.module.rules[0].test = /\.((tsx?)|(jsx?)|(es6))$/:
#                 return config;

# ENTRIES AND CHUNKING:
# If nothing is added below, this is the default behaviour:
#   - Default entry source folder is /site/, that is: src/main/resources/site/ and its subfolders.
#   - Everything under react4xp root folder (src/main/resources/react4xp/) will be considered chunks and will
#       be bundled by webpack into a single dependency imported by webpack: react4xp.<contenthash>.js
#   - Everything under the react4xp root folder (src/main/resources/react4xp/) will be considered non-entries:
#       added files here can be imported by react4xp entries, but otherwise unreachable from react4xp.
#   - Default entryExtensions (file extensions to look for when finding entries under OTHER entryDirs than /site/) are:
#       jsx, js, tsx, ts, es6, es
#
# chunkDirs are folder names where importable, non-entry code is kept. Comma-separated list of folder names, relative
#       to src/main/resources/react4xp/. Each folder added here will be bundled by webpack into a separate dependency
#       chunk with the same name as the folder, and a hash: <foldername>.<contenthash>.js. This is good for grouping
#       sets of dependencies that belong together, or will frequently be requested from the client together in some parts
#       of a web page but not others, etc. The react4xp root (src/main/resources/react4xp/) is the standard chunk 'react4xp',
#       but you can add subfolders here to bundle them (and their subfolders) in separate chunks. Or you can add relative
#       paths to the react4xp root to imported dependency code from elsewhere. Don't overlap with entryDirs or /site/.
#
# entryDirs are additional folder names where webpack will look for entry files. Comma-separated list of folder names,
#       relative to src/main/resources/react4xp/. By default, react4xp instructs webpack to look for entries under
#       src/main/resources/site/ (and in the react4xp-templates package). Added folders here will be kept out of bundled
#       dependency chunks (take care to avoid directory overlaps with chunkDirs) and treated separately. Files in
#       them will be compiled into react4xp entries, which most importantly get a jsxPath (relative to their entryDir, not
#       relative to /react4xp/) and therefore are available to react4xp.
#
# entryExtensions are filename extensions of files (comma-separated list) below the entryDirs folders that webpack should
#       look for and turn into entries. NOTE that this doesn't apply to the default entry-folder src/main/resources/site/
#       (or the react4xp-templates package), where ONLY .jsx (and .tsx) files can be entries. This is to avoid mixups with
#       XP controllers etc, which can be .js or .es6. Default value if not changed is jsx,js,tsx,ts,es6,es. Also note that
#       tsx/ts files are NOT supported out of the box. Rules for typescript compilation must be added in your own
#       overrideComponentWebpack file (see above).

# Overrides SSR lazy dependency loading. If not overridden (aka, if commented out below), it depends on build mode (buildEnv above):
#           true in dev, false in prod.
# If false: all assets are loaded into the SSR engine as soon as it's initialized (on the first SSR):
#           nashornpolyfills, externals, vendors, dependency chunks, react4xp-regions and entries, in that order.
#           Fixed engine warm-up time, no further warm-up after initialization.
# If true: only nashornpolyfills and externals assets are loaded on engine initialization. Each entry and its dependency assets are
#           loaded (and cached for shared re-use across entries) only the first time that entry is rendered,
#           instead of loading everything on app startup.
#           Here, initial engine warm-up time is shorter than without lazy-loading, and depends on which entry is rendered first
#           - but the next entry rendering might require some more asset loading the first time THAT is rendered, etc.

#           --persistent-code-cache, --class-cache-size=1000
# If only a number, changes the the number in --class-cache-size=<number> in the default setting above.
# If that number is set to 0 (or less), persistent code cache is switched off. Might affect performance positively or negatively, depending on your project.
# If a full string (more than just a number): completely overrides the default settings.
#           Interpreted as a comma-separated list of settings, same format as the default settings above, for example:
