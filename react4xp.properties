# buildEnv sets the build mode:
#   - 'production' yields compact output and will overwrite existing symlinks under node_modules. If needed, they must be rebuilt.
#   - 'development' enables more verbose terminal output during build,
#   - 'development' keeps compiled code more readable,
#   - 'development' controls npmInstall.gradle, and instructs it to run the nsiInstall task instead of npmInstall.
#                   NsiInstall uses node-safe-install to wrap "npm install" in order to preserve existing symlinks under node_modules.
# Default build mode is 'production', but can be overridden with CLI arg: -Pdev or -Pdevelopment -Pdev when running gradle.
# Or uncomment the following line to lock development build mode:
#
# buildEnv = development

# A minimal webpack config is included with react4xp, to build your react components and their dependencies: See node_modules/react4xp-build-components/webpack.config.js.
# To change this setup, or override or extend that webpack.configjs:
# make a custom file that default-exports EITHER a finished webpack-style config object, OR a function.
# The function should take an "env" and "config" argument:
#   - Env is the collection of "--env." CLI arguments, and
#   - Config is the default config from react4xp-build-components/webpack.config.js.
# Manipulate or replace the config object AND return it.
# Example file:
#             module.exports = function(env, config) {
#                 config.module.rules[0].test = /\.((tsx?)|(jsx?)|(es6))$/:
#                 return config;
#             };
# Finally, refer to that file here (path/filename relative to this project's root):
#

# ENTRIES AND CHUNKING:
# If nothing is added below, this is the default behaviour:
#   - Default entry source folder is /site/, that is: src/main/resources/site/ and its subfolders.
#   - Everything under react4xp root folder (src/main/resources/react4xp/) will be considered chunks and will
#       be bundled by webpack into a single dependency imported by webpack: react4xp.<contenthash>.js
#   - Everything under the react4xp root folder (src/main/resources/react4xp/) will be considered non-entries:
#       added files here can be imported by react4xp entries, but otherwise unreachable from react4xp.
#   - Default entryExtensions (file extensions to look for when finding entries under OTHER entryDirs than /site/) are:
#       jsx, js, tsx, ts, es6, es
#
# chunkDirs are folder names where importable, non-entry code is kept. Comma-separated list of folder names, relative
#       to src/main/resources/react4xp/. Each folder added here will be bundled by webpack into a separate dependency
#       chunk with the same name as the folder, and a hash: <foldername>.<contenthash>.js. This is good for grouping
#       sets of dependencies that belong together, or will frequently be requested from the client together in some parts
#       of a web page but not others, etc. The react4xp root (src/main/resources/react4xp/) is the standard chunk 'react4xp',
#       but you can add subfolders here to bundle them (and their subfolders) in separate chunks. Or you can add relative
#       paths to the react4xp root to imported dependency code from elsewhere. Don't overlap with entryDirs or /site/.
#
# entryDirs are additional folder names where webpack will look for entry files. Comma-separated list of folder names,
#       relative to src/main/resources/react4xp/. By default, react4xp instructs webpack to look for entries under
#       src/main/resources/site/ (and in the react4xp-templates package). Added folders here will be kept out of bundled
#       dependency chunks (take care to avoid directory overlaps with chunkDirs) and treated separately. Files in
#       them will be compiled into react4xp entries, which most importantly get a jsxPath (relative to their entryDir, not
#       relative to /react4xp/) and therefore are available to react4xp.
#
# entryExtensions are filename extensions of files (comma-separated list) below the entryDirs folders that webpack should
#       look for and turn into entries. NOTE that this doesn't apply to the default entry-folder src/main/resources/site/
#       (or the react4xp-templates package), where ONLY .jsx (and .tsx) files can be entries. This is to avoid mixups with
#       XP controllers etc, which can be .js or .es6. Default value if not changed is jsx,js,tsx,ts,es6,es. Also note that
#       tsx/ts files are NOT supported out of the box. Rules for typescript compilation must be added in your own
#       overrideComponentWebpack file (see above).

# Overrides SSR lazy dependency loading. If not overridden (aka, if commented out below), it depends on build mode (buildEnv above):
#           true in dev, false in prod.
# If false: all assets are loaded into the SSR engine as soon as it's initialized (on the first SSR):
#           nashornpolyfills, externals, vendors, dependency chunks, react4xp-regions and entries, in that order.
#           Fixed engine warm-up time, no further warm-up after initialization.
# If true: only nashornpolyfills and externals assets are loaded on engine initialization. Each entry and its dependency assets are
#           loaded (and cached for shared re-use across entries) only the first time that entry is rendered,
#           instead of loading everything on app startup.
#           Here, initial engine warm-up time is shorter than without lazy-loading, and depends on which entry is rendered first
#           - but the next entry rendering might require some more asset loading the first time THAT is rendered, etc.

# Override SSR engine settings.
# Ref: https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn/blob/main/src/org.openjdk.nashorn/share/classes/org/openjdk/nashorn/internal/runtime/resources/Options.properties
# Default settings (if commented out) is:
#           1000
#           This corresponds to:
#           --persistent-code-cache, --class-cache-size=1000
# If only a number, changes the the number in --class-cache-size=<number> in the default setting above.
# If that number is set to 0 (or less), persistent code cache is switched off. Might affect performance positively or negatively, depending on your project.
# If a full string (more than just a number): completely overrides the default settings.
#           Interpreted as a comma-separated list of settings, same format as the default settings above, for example:
#           --persistent-code-cache, --class-cache-size=42, --lazy-compilation
#
# ssrSettings = 0

# Override the maximum SSR thread/engine count.
#
# Default value (if commented out): 0, which means no limit on number of threads - will be set to the number of available CPU cores.
# If set as a number above 0, limits the number of SSR engines that are available for simultaneous server-side rendering.
#
# It's usually not necessary to set a limit on this, the java thread model will limit it to the amount of available cores (and maybe multiplied, depending on CPU hyperthreading etc).
# However, each SSR engine will load the assets it needs for rendering into memory, in its own independent nashorn engine and memory space.
# And for performance reasons, these engines will be re-used as much as possible, trying to avoid initializing new engines.
# In other words, the memory used will NOT be cleared and made available after a rendering, but the engines will keep already-loaded assets
# in memory. And in the long run, the result will probably be that every engine will keep every compiled react asset in memory.
# If this ever becomes a problem, the ssrMaxThreads can be used to set a limit on this.
#
# ssrMaxThreads = 0
