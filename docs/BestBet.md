# Best-bet app

A standalone application where we can add and manage best bets to our xp content. The application contains a list of xp contents (such as pages, statistics, articles etc.) and the search words attached to each content. Features include creating new best bets using a form and editing and/or deleting existing best bets directly through the list.

## Repository and Services

The best-bet data is parsed and stored in nodes, which can be found in Data Toolbox in the `no.ssb.bestbet` repository. All of the functions to get and alter the data in these specific nodes are located in the [src/main/resources/lib/ssb/repo/bestbet.ts](src/main/resources/lib/ssb/repo/bestbet.ts) file.

We use [an xp service](src/main/resources/services/bestBetList/bestBetList.es6) that we send GET, POST or DELETE requests to. The service will either return a list of best bets, delete or update a node using the best bet repo lib functions.

In order to get a list of xp contents to pick from when we create a best bet for the first time, we use the [content search service](src/main/resources/services/contentSearch/contentSearch.ts). The service will expect an input parameter, run a query towards Data toolbox nodes to find matches, and from the query result hits, we only return the values we need.

## Controller and View

For the application's interface, we use Thymeleaf and React. Thymeleaf will render the assets and page contributions provided in the [controller](src/main/resources/admin/tools/bestbet/bestbet.ts), as well as the container for the [React component](src/main/resources/react4xp/_entries/bestbet/Bestbet.jsx). While the service and Content Studio base urls are set as React props.

Most of the interface's functionality is in the [React component](src/main/resources/react4xp/_entries/bestbet/Bestbet.jsx). The best bet list is displayed and handled with React. We use axios to send GET, POST and DELETE requests to the service, which are triggered by interacting with the buttons and dropdown.
