# React4xp
## Server-side Rendering (SSR)
We should try to use server-side rendering for all react components because of crawlers or other that run the website without javascript. For now, there are at least one case where we can't use SSR for now, and that is where we need to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for HTML Content. Ref. [issue](https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/issues/33)

Example for SSR only: [Breadcrumbs.jsx](/src/main/resources/react4xp/_entries/Breadcrumb.jsx) and [default.es6](/src/main/resources/site/pages/default/default.es6)

## Hydrate (Without SSR)
If there are problems where SSR doesn't work at all, clientRender: true can be used in renderBody and renderPageContributions. We should try to never use it, because then the part will never be visible/rendered for non-js users.

## SSR and Hydrate
Hydration is needed for react components with client side interaction. You need to add pageContributions for this to work (ref. [factBox.ts](/src/main/resources/site/parts/factBox/factBox.ts)).

## LifeCycle and State
If we want to make more complex components/containers for react we can create classes that extends the React.Component class. This will open of for the possibility to use [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class) and [lifecycles](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle). Ref. [Header.jsx](/src/main/resources/react4xp/_entries/Header.jsx)

## Entries
After you've run `enonic project build` or `enonic project deploy` at least once, you'll have a file in your build folder with a list of all react4xp components available. `/build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/entries.json`
